# Frodo

Frodo is a Rails-like app generator for Node and Express. It was created to simplify work
with projects based on Express framework. Nowadays, many developers are familiar with Ruby on Rails
framework, so app generated with Frodo will help you to kickstart faster.

**Motivation:**
  * I use Rails a lot and I love how Rails apps are organized
  * Sometimes, it is difficult to start with a micro-framework like Express without predefined structure.
    I want to help developers who begin using Node/Express to create a new app as fast as posible.
